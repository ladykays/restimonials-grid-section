## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I had the opportunity to put in practice what I learnt about CSS Grid. It was challenging to get the quotation image to be placed behind the text but I was able to get it to work using the `grid-area` property.
```
  .bg-pattern-quotation {
    grid-area: 1 / 3 / 3 / 4;
  }
```

### Continued development
The area I need to continue working on is: 
* CSS Grid Placement 


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex) - This helped convert HSL to HEX format
- [Resource 2](https://yuangela.com/gridgarden/) - This is an amazing site helped me practice working with css grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Resource 3](https://gist.github.com/lopspower/03fb1cc0ac9f32ef38f4) - This was very useful to get the color codes for transparency.
